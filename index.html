        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
        <p>
            On this special day, I wanted to take a moment to celebrate you and all the wonderful qualities 
            that make you so amazing. Your kindness, humor, and genuine heart bring so much joy to everyone 
            around you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wishing you a birthday as bright and beautiful as you are. Here's to many more wonderful years ahead!
        </p>
        <p>
            With lots of love and warm wishes,<br>
